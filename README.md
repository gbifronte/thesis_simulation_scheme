We implement the simulation scheme of (Bayer and Breneis, 2023) for the rough Bergomi model
$$ 
dS_t &= S_t \sqrt{V_t} dB^S_{t}, \hs S_0>0, 
$$
$$ 
V_t &= V_0 \exp\left( \eta \sqrt{2H} \int_0^t (t-s)^{H-1/2} dB^V_s - \frac{\eta^2}{2}t^{2H}\right), \hs V_0>0 
$$
along with the optimal wealth process established in (Bifronte, 2024).
