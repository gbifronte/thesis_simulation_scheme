# Simulation scheme
We implement the simulation scheme of (Bayer and Breneis, 2022) for the rough Bergomi model of the form

We then simulate the optimal terminal wealth of a financial market comprising one bond and the rough Bergomi model, 
with a stock price that includes drift, as established in (Bifronte, 2024).
